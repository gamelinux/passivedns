1.x.x

1.6.1   2009-09-14
	* --enable-gost : use the GOST algorithm (experimental).
	* Added some missing options to drill manpage
	* Some fixes to --without-ssl option
	* Fixed quote parsing withing strings
	* Bitmask fix in EDNS handling
	* Fixed non-fqdn domain name completion for rdata field domain
	  names of length 1
	* Fixed chain validation with SHA256 DS records

1.6.0
	Additions:
	* Addition of an ldns-config script which gives cflags and libs
	  values, for use in configure scripts for applications that use
	  use ldns. Can be disabled with ./configure --disable-ldns-config
	* Added direct sha1, sha256, and sha512 support in ldns.
	  With these functions, all NSEC3 functionality can still be
	  used, even if ldns is built without OpenSSL. Thanks to OpenBSD,
	  Steve Reid, and Aaron D. Gifford for the code.
	* Added reading/writing support for the SPF Resource Record
	* Base32 functions are now exported
	Bugfixes:
	* ldns_is_rrset did not go through the complete rrset, but
	  only compared the first two records. Thanks to Olafur
	  Gudmundsson for report and patch
	* Fixed a small memory bug in ldns_rr_list_subtype_by_rdf(),
	  thanks to Marius Rieder for finding an patching this.
	* --without-ssl should now work. Make sure that examples/ and
	  drill also get the --without-ssl flag on their configure, if
	  this is used.
	* Some malloc() return value checks have been added
	* NSEC3 creation has been improved wrt to empty nonterminals,
	  and opt-out.
	* Fixed a bug in the parser when reading large NSEC3 salt
	  values.
	* Made the allowed length for domain names on wire
	  and presentation format the same.
	Example tools:
	* ldns-key2ds can now also generate DS records for keys without
	  the SEP flag
	* ldns-signzone now equalizes the TTL of the DNSKEY RRset (to
	  the first non-default DNSKEY TTL value it sees)
	
1.5.1
	Example tools:
	* ldns-signzone was broken in 1.5.0 for multiple keys, this
          has been repaired

	Build system:
        * Removed a small erroneous output warning in
          examples/configure and drill/configure

1.5.0
	Bug fixes:
	* fixed a possible memory overflow in the RR parser
	* build flag fix for Sun Studio
	* fixed a building race condition in the copying of header
	  files
	* EDNS0 extended rcode; the correct assembled code number
	  is now printed (still in the EDNS0 field, though)
	* ldns_pkt_rr no longer leaks memory (in fact, it no longer
	  copies anything all)

	API addition:
	* ldns_key now has support for 'external' data, in which
	  case the OpenSSL EVP structures are not used;
	  ldns_key_set_external_key() and ldns_key_external_key()
	* added ldns_key_get_file_base_name() which creates a 
	  'default' filename base string for key storage, of the
	  form "K<zone>+<algorithm>+<keytag>"
	* the ldns_dnssec_* family of structures now have deep_free()
	  functions, which also free the ldns_rr's contained in them
	* there is now an ldns_match_wildcard() function, which checks
	  whether a domain name matches a wildcard name
	* ldns_sign_public has been split up; this resulted in the
	  addition of ldns_create_empty_rrsig() and
	  ldns_sign_public_buffer()

	Examples:
	* ldns-signzone can now automatically add DNSKEY records when
	  using an OpenSSL engine, as it already did when using key
	  files
	* added new example tool: ldns-nsec3-hash
	* ldns-dpa can now filter on specific query name and types
	* ldnsd has fixes for the zone name, a fix for the return
          value of recvfrom(), and an memory initialization fix
          (Thanks to Colm MacCárthaigh for the patch)
        * Fixed memory leaks in ldnsd



1.4.1
	Bug fixes:
	* fixed a build issue where ldns lib existence was done too early
	* removed unnecessary check for pcap.h
	* NSEC3 optout flag now correctly printed in string output
	* inttypes.h moved to configured inclusion
	* fixed NSEC3 type bitmaps for empty nonterminals and unsigned
	  delegations 

	API addition:
	* for that last fix, we added a new function
	  ldns_dname_add_from() that can clone parts of a dname

		- ldns_rr_type2str
		- ldns_rr_class2str
		- ldns_rr_type2buffer_str
		- ldns_rr_class2buffer_str
	* buffer2str() is now called ldns_buffer2str
	* base32 and base64 function names are now also prepended with ldns_
	* ldns_rr_new_frm_str() now returns an error on missing RDATA fields.
	  Since you cannot read QUESTION section RRs with this anymore,
	  there is now a function called ldns_rr_new_question_frm_str()

	LIBRARY FEATURES:
	* DS RRs string representation now add bubblebabble in a comment
	  (patch from Jakob Schlyter)
	* DLV RR type added
	* TCP fallback system has been improved
	* HMAC-SHA256 TSIG support has been added.
	* TTLS are now correcly set in NSEC(3) records when signing zones
	
	EXAMPLE TOOLS:

	* ldns-testpkts has been fixed and updated
	* ldns-signzone now has the option to not add the DNSKEY
	* ldns-signzone now has an (full zone only) opt-out option for
	                NSEC3
	* ldns-keygen can create HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-SHA256 symmetric keys
	* ldns-walk output has been fixed
	* ldns-compare-zones has been fixed, and now has an option
	  to show all differences (-a)
	* ldns-read-zone now has an option to print DNSSEC records only

1.3
	Base library:

	* Added a new family of functions based around ldns_dnssec_zone,
	which is a new structure that keeps a zone sorted through an
	rbtree and links signatures and NSEC(3) records directly to their
	RRset. These functions all start with ldns_dnssec_

	* ldns_zone_sign and ldns_zone_sign_nsec3 are now deprecated, but
	have been changed to internally use the new
	ldns_dnssec_zone_sign(_nsec3)

	* Moved some ldns_buffer functions inline, so a clean rebuild of
	applications relying on those is needed (otherwise you'll get
	linker errors)
	* ldns_dname_label now returns one extra (zero)
	byte, so it can be seen as an fqdn.
	* NSEC3 type code update for signing algorithms.
	* DSA key generation of DNSKEY RRs fixed (one byte too small).

	* Added support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512, as specified in
	draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-rsasha256-04. The typecodes are not
	final, and this feature is not enabled by default. It can be
	enabled at compilation time with the flag --with-sha2

	* Added 2wire_canonical family of functions that lowercase dnames
	in rdata fields in resource records of the types in the list in
	rfc3597

	* Added base32 conversion functions.

	* Fixed DSA RRSIG conversion when calling OpenSSL

	Drill:

	* Chase output is completely different, it shows, in ascii, the
	relations in the trust hierarchy.

	Examples:
	* Added ldns-verify-zone, that can verify the internal DNSSEC records
	of a signed BIND-style zone file

	* ldns-keygen now takes an -a argument specifying the algorithm,
	instead of -R or -D. -a list show a list of supported algorithms

	* ldns-keygen now defaults to the exponent RSA_F4 instead of RSA_3
	for RSA key generation

	* ldns-signzone now has support for HSMs
	* ldns-signzone uses the new ldns_dnssec_ structures and functions
	which improves its speed, and output; RRSIGS are now placed
	directly after their RRset, NSEC(3) records directly after the
	name they handle

	Contrib:
	* new contrib/ dir with user contributions
	* added compilation script for solaris (thanks to Jakob Schlyter)
	
28 Nov 2007 1.2.2:
	* Added support for HMAC-MD5 keys in generator
	* Added a new example tool (written by Ondrej Sury): ldns-compare-zones

	* Fixed a $ORIGIN error when reading zones
	* Fixed another off-by-one error

03 Oct 2007 1.2.1:
	* Fixed an offset error in rr comparison
	* Fixed ldns-read-zone exit code
	* Added check for availability of SHA256 hashing algorithm
	* Fixed ldns-key2ds -2 argument
	* Fixed $ORIGIN bug in .key files
	* Output algorithms as an integer instead of their mnemonic
	* Fixed a memory leak in dnssec code when SHA256 is not available
	* Updated fedora .spec file

11 Apr 2007 1.2.0:
	* canonicalization of rdata in DNSSEC functions now adheres to the
          rr type list in rfc3597, not rfc4035, which will be updated
	  (see http://www.ops.ietf.org/lists/namedroppers/namedroppers.2007/msg00183.html)
	* ldns-walk now support dnames with maximum label length
	* ldnsd now takes an extra argument containing the address to listen on
	* signing no longer signs every rrset with KSK's, but only the DNSKEY rrset
	* ported to Solaris 10
	* added ldns_send_buffer() function
	* added ldns-testpkts fake packet server
	* added ldns-notify to send NOTIFY packets
	* ldns-dpa can now accurately calculate the number of matches per
	  second
	* libtool is now used for compilation too (still gcc, but not directly)
	* Bugfixes:
		- TSIG signing buffer size
		- resolv.conf reading (comments)
		- dname comparison off by one error
		- typo in keyfetchers output file name fixed (a . too much)
		- fixed zone file parser when comments contain ( or )
		- fixed LOC RR type
		- fixed CERT RR type

	Drill:
	* drill prints error on failed axfr.
	* drill now accepts mangled packets with -f
	* old -c option (use tcp) changed to -t
	* -c option to specify alternative resolv.conf file added
	* feedback of signature chase improved
	* chaser now stops at root when no trusted keys are found
	  instead of looping forever trying to find the DS for .
	* Fixed bugs:
		- wildcard on multiple labels signature verification
		- error in -f packet writing for malformed packets
		- made KSK check more resilient

7 Jul 2006: 1.1.0: ldns-team
	* Added tutorials and an introduction to the documentation
	* Added include/ and lib/ dirs so that you can compile against ldns
	  without installing ldns on your system
	* Makefile updates
	* Starting usage of assert throughout the library to catch illegal calls
	* Solaris 9 testing was carried out. Ldns now compiles on that
	  platform; some gnuism were identified and fixed.
	* The ldns_zone structure was stress tested. The current setup
	 (ie. just a list of rrs) can scale to zone file in order of
  	  megabytes. Sorting such zone is still difficult.
	* Reading multiline b64 encoded rdata works.
	* OpenSSL was made optional, configure --without-ssl.
	  Ofcourse all dnssec/tsig related functions are disabled
	* Building of examples and drill now happens with the same
	  defines as the building of ldns itself.
	* Preliminary sha-256 support was added. Currently is your
     	  OpenSSL supports it, it is supported in the DS creation.
	* ldns_resolver_search was implemented
	* Fixed a lot of bugs

	Drill:
	* -r was killed in favor of -o <header bit mnemonic> which 
	  allows for a header bits setting (and maybe more in the
	  future)
	* DNSSEC is never automaticaly set, even when you query
	  for DNSKEY/RRSIG or DS.
	* Implement a crude RTT check, it now distinguishes between
	  reachable and unreachable.
        * A form of secure tracing was added
        * Secure Chasing has been improved
	* -x does a reverse lookup for the given IP address
	
	Examples:
	* ldns-dpa was added to the examples - this is the Dns Packet
	  Analyzer tool.
	* ldnsd - as very, very simple nameserver impl.
	* ldns-zsplit - split zones for parrallel signing
	* ldns-zcat - cat split zones back together
        * ldns-keyfetcher - Fetches DNSKEY records with a few (non-strong, 
	  non-DNSSEC) anti-spoofing techniques.
	* ldns-walk - 'Walks' a DNSSEC signed zone
	* Added an all-static target to the makefile so you can use examples
	  without installing the library
	* When building in the source tree or in a direct subdirectory of
	  the build dir, configure does not need --with-ldns=../ anymore

	Code:
	* All networking code was moved to net.c
	* rdata.c: added asserts to the rdf set/get functions
	* const keyword was added to pointer arguments that 
	  aren't changed

	API:
	Changed:
	* renamed ldns/dns.h to ldns/ldns.h
	* ldns_rr_new_frm_str() is extented with an extra variable which
	  in common use may be NULL. This trickles through to:
          o ldns_rr_new_frm_fp
	  o ldns_rr_new_frm_fp_l
	  Which also get an extra variable
	  Also the function has been changed to return a status message.
	  The compiled RR is returned in the first argument.
	* ldns_zone_new_frm_fp_l()  and ldns_zone_new_frm_fp() are
          changed to return a status msg.
	* ldns_key_new_frm_fp is changed to return ldns_status and
	  the actual key list in the first argument
	* ldns_rdata_new_frm_fp[_l]() are changed to return a status.
	  the rdf is return in the first argument
        * ldns_resolver_new_frm_fp: same treatment: return status and 
	  the new resolver in the first argument
	* ldns_pkt_query_new_frm_str(): same: return status and the
	  packet in the first arg
	* tsig.h: internal used functions are now static:
	  ldns_digest_name and ldns_tsig_mac_new
	* ldns_key_rr2ds has an extra argument to specify the hash to
	  use.
	* ldns_pkt_rcode() is renamed to ldns_pkt_get_rcode, ldns_pkt_rcode
	  is now the rcode type, like ldns_pkt_opcode
	New:
	* ldns_resolver_searchlist_count: return the searchlist counter
	* ldns_zone_sort: Sort a zone
	* ldns_bgsend(): background send, returns a socket.
	* ldns_pkt_empty(): check is a packet is empty
	* ldns_rr_list_pop_rr_list(): pop multiple rr's from another rr_list
	* ldns_rr_list_push_rr_list(): push multiple rr's to an rr_list
        * ldns_rr_list_compare(): compare 2 ldns_rr_lists
	* ldns_pkt_push_rr_list: rr_list equiv for rr
	* ldns_pkt_safe_push_rr_list: rr_list equiv for rr
	Removed:
	* ldns_resolver_bgsend(): was not used in 1.0.0 and is not used now
	* ldns_udp_server_connect(): was faulty and isn't really part of
	  the core ldns idea any how.
	* ldns_rr_list_insert_rr(): obsoleted, because not used.
	* char *_when was removed from the ldns_pkt structure

18 Oct 2005: 1.0.0: ldns-team
	* Commited a patch from Håkan Olsson
	* Added UPDATE support (Jakob Schlyter and Håkan Olsson)
	* License change: ldns is now BSD licensed
	* ldns now depends on SSL
	* Networking code cleanup, added (some) server udp/tcp support
	* A zone type is introduced. Currently this is a list
	  of RRs, so it will not scale well.
