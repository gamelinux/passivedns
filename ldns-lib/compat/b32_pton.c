5.  Base 32 Encoding

   The Base 32 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of
   octets in a form that needs to be case insensitive but need not be
   humanly readable.

   A 33-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 5 bits to be
   represented per printable character.  (The extra 33rd character, "=",
   is used to signify a special processing function.)

   The encoding process represents 40-bit groups of input bits as output
   strings of 8 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to right, a
   40-bit input group is formed by concatenating 5 8bit input groups.
   These 40 bits are then treated as 8 concatenated 5-bit groups, each
   of which is translated into a single digit in the base 32 alphabet.
   When encoding a bit stream via the base 32 encoding, the bit stream
   must be presumed to be ordered with the most-significant-bit first.
   That is, the first bit in the stream will be the high-order bit in
   the first 8bit byte, and the eighth bit will be the low-order bit in
   the first 8bit byte, and so on.

   Each 5-bit group is used as an index into an array of 32 printable
   characters.  The character referenced by the index is placed in the
   output string.  These characters, identified in Table 3, below, are
   selected from US-ASCII digits and uppercase letters.

                      Table 3: The Base 32 Alphabet

             1 B            10 K            19 T            28 4

             8 I            17 R            26 2


   Special processing is performed if fewer than 40 bits are available
   at the end of the data being encoded.  A full encoding quantum is
   always completed at the end of a body.  When fewer than 40 input bits
   are available in an input group, zero bits are added (on the right)
   to form an integral number of 5-bit groups.  Padding at the end of
   the data is performed using the "=" character.  Since all base 32
   input is an integral number of octets, only the following cases can
   arise:

   (1) the final quantum of encoding input is an integral multiple of 40
   bits; here, the final unit of encoded output will be an integral
   multiple of 8 characters with no "=" padding,

   (2) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 8 bits; here, the
   final unit of encoded output will be two characters followed by six
   "=" padding characters,

   (3) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 16 bits; here, the
   final unit of encoded output will be four characters followed by four
   "=" padding characters,

   (4) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 24 bits; here, the
   final unit of encoded output will be five characters followed by
   three "=" padding characters, or

   (5) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 32 bits; here, the
   final unit of encoded output will be seven characters followed by one
   "=" padding character.


6.  Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet

   The following description of base 32 is due to [7].  This encoding
   should not be regarded as the same as the "base32" encoding, and
   should not be referred to as only "base32".

   One property with this alphabet, that the base32 and base32 alphabet
   lack, is that encoded data maintain its sort order when the encoded
   data is compared bit-wise.

   This encoding is identical to the previous one, except for the
   alphabet.  The new alphabet is found in table 4.
