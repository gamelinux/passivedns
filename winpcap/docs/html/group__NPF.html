<p>This section documents the internals of the Netgroup Packet Filter (NPF), the kernel
portion of WinPcap. Normal users are probably interested in how to use WinPcap
and not in its internal structure. Therefore
the information present in this module is destined mainly to WinPcap developers and maintainers, or to
the people interested in how the driver works. In particular, a good knowledge
of OSes, networking and Win32 kernel programming and device drivers development
is required to profitably read this section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NPF is the WinPcap component that does the hard work, processing the packets
that transit on the network and exporting capture, injection and analysis
capabilities to user-level.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs will describe the interaction of NPF with the
OS and its basic structure.</p>
<h2>NPF and NDIS</h2>
<p>NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification) is a standard that defines the
communication between a network adapter (or, better, the driver that manages it)
and the protocol drivers (that implement for example TCP/IP). Main NDIS purpose
is to act as a wrapper that allows protocol drivers to send and receive packets
onto a network (LAN or WAN) without caring either the particular adapter or the
particular Win32 operating system.</p>
<p>NDIS supports three types of network drivers:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Network interface card or NIC drivers</strong>. NIC drivers
    directly manage network interface cards, referred to as NICs. The NIC
    drivers interface directly to the hardware at their lower edge and at their
    upper edge present an interface to allow upper layers to send packets on the
    network, to handle interrupts, to reset the NIC, to halt the NIC and to
    query and set the operational characteristics of the driver. NIC drivers can
    be either miniports or legacy full NIC drivers.
    <ul>
      <li>Miniport drivers implement only the hardware-specific operations
        necessary to manage a NIC, including sending and receiving data on the
        NIC. Operations common to all lowest level NIC drivers, such as
        synchronization, is provided by NDIS. Miniports do not call operating
        system routines directly; their interface to the operating system is
        NDIS.<br>
        A miniport does not keep track of bindings. It merely passes packets up
        to NDIS and NDIS makes sure that these packets are passed to the correct
        protocols.
      <li>Full NIC drivers have been written to perform both hardware-specific
        operations and all the synchronization and queuing operations usually
        done by NDIS. Full NIC drivers, for instance, maintain their own binding
        information for indicating received data.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Intermediate drivers</strong>. Intermediate drivers interface
    between an upper-level driver such as a protocol driver and a miniport. To
    the upper-level driver, an intermediate driver looks like a miniport. To a
    miniport, the intermediate driver looks like a protocol driver. An
    intermediate protocol driver can layer on top of another intermediate driver
    although such layering could have a negative effect on system performance. A
    typical reason for developing an intermediate driver is to perform media
    translation between an existing legacy protocol driver and a miniport that
    manages a NIC for a new media type unknown to the protocol driver. For
    instance, an intermediate driver could translate from LAN protocol to ATM
    protocol. An intermediate driver cannot communicate with user-mode
    applications, but only with other NDIS drivers.
  <li><b>Transport drivers or protocol drivers</b>. A protocol driver implements
    a network protocol stack such as IPX/SPX or TCP/IP, offering its services
    over one or more network interface cards. A protocol driver services
    application-layer clients at its upper edge and connects to one or more NIC
    driver(s) or intermediate NDIS driver(s) at its lower edge.</li>
</ol>
<p>NPF is implemented as a protocol driver. This is not the best possible choice
from the performance point of view, but allows reasonable independence from the
MAC layer and as well as complete access to the raw traffic.</p>
<p>Notice that the various Win32 operating systems have different versions of
NDIS: NPF is NDIS 5 compliant under Windows 2000 and its derivations (like
Windows XP), NDIS 3
compliant on the other Win32 platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next figure shows the position of NPF inside the NDIS stack:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="npf-ndis.gif"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 1: NPF inside NDIS.</b></p>
<p>The interaction with the OS is normally asynchronous. This means that the
driver provides a set of callback functions that are invoked by the system when
some operation is required to NPF. NPF exports callback functions for all the I/O operations of the
applications: open, close, read, write, ioctl, etc.</p>
<p>The interaction with NDIS is asynchronous as well: events
like the arrival of a new packet are notified to NPF through a callback
function (Packet_tap() in this case). Furthermore, the interaction with NDIS and
the NIC
driver takes always place by means of non blocking functions: when NPF invokes a
NDIS function, the call returns immediately; when the processing ends, NDIS invokes
a specific NPF
callback to inform that the function has finished. The
driver exports a callback for any low-level operation, like sending packets,
setting or requesting parameters on the NIC, etc.</p>

<h2>NPF structure basics</h2>

<p>Next figure shows the structure of WinPcap, with particular reference to the
NPF driver.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2: NPF device driver.</b>

<p>NPF is able to
perform a number of different operations: capture, monitoring, dump to disk,
packet injection. The following paragraphs will describe shortly each of these
operations.</p>
<h4>Packet Capture</h4>
<p>The most important operation of NPF is packet capture.
During a capture, the driver sniffs the packets using a network interface and delivers them intact to the
user-level applications.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The capture process relies on two main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A packet filter that decides if an
    incoming packet has to be accepted and copied to the listening application.
    Most applications using NPF reject far more packets than those accepted,
    therefore a versatile and efficient packet filter is critical for good
    over-all performance. A packet filter is a function with boolean output
    that is applied to a packet. If the value of the function is true the
    capture driver copies
    the packet to the application; if it is false the packet is discarded. NPF
    packet filter is a bit more complex, because it determines not only if the
    packet should be kept, but also the amount of bytes to keep. The filtering
    system adopted by NPF derives from the <b>BSD Packet Filter</b> (BPF), a 
	virtual processor able to execute filtering programs expressed in a 
	pseudo-assembler and created at user level. The application takes a user-defined filter (e.g. “pick up all UDP packets”)
    and, using wpcap.dll, compiles them into a BPF program (e.g. “if the
    packet is IP and the <i>protocol type</i>  field is equal to 17, then return
    true”). Then, the application uses the <i>BIOCSETF</i>
    IOCTL to inject the filter in the kernel. At this point, the program
    is executed for every incoming packet, and only the conformant packets are
    accepted. Unlike traditional solutions, NPF does not <i>interpret</i>
    the filters, but it <i>executes</i> them. For performance reasons, before using the
    filter NPF feeds it to a JIT compiler that translates it into a native 80x86
    function. When a packet is captured, NPF calls this native function instead
    of invoking the filter interpreter, and this makes the process very fast.
    The concept behind this optimization is very similar to the one of Java
    jitters.</li>
  <li>
    <p>A circular buffer to store the
    packets and avoid loss. A packet is stored in the buffer with a header that
    maintains information like the timestamp and the size of the packet.
    Moreover, an alignment padding is inserted between the packets in order to
    speed-up the access to their data by the applications. Groups of&nbsp; packets can be copied
    with a single operation from the NPF buffer to the applications. This
    improves performances because it minimizes the number of reads. If the
    buffer is full when a new packet arrives, the packet is discarded and
    hence it's lost. Both kernel and user buffer can be
changed at runtime for maximum versatility: packet.dll and wpcap.dll provide functions for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>The size of the user buffer is very
important because it determines the <i>maximum</i> amount of data that can be
copied from kernel space to user space within a single system call. On the other
hand, it can be noticed that also the <i>minimum</i> amount of data that can be copied
in a single call is extremely important. In presence of a large value for this
variable, the kernel waits for the arrival of several packets before copying the
data to the user. This guarantees a low number of system calls, i.e. low
processor usage, which is a good setting for applications like sniffers. On the
other side, a small value means that the kernel will copy the packets as soon as
the application is ready to receive them. This is excellent for real time
applications (like, for example, ARP redirectors or bridges) that need the better
responsiveness from the kernel.
From this point of view, NPF has a configurable behavior, that allows users to choose between
best efficiency or best responsiveness (or any intermediate situation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wpcap library includes a couple of system calls that can be used both to set the timeout after
which a read expires and the minimum amount of data that can be transferred to
the application. By default, the read timeout is 1 second, and the minimum
amount of data copied between the kernel and the application is 16K.</p>
<h4> Packet injection</h4>
<p> NPF allows to write raw packets to the network. To send data, a
user-level application performs a WriteFile() system call on the NPF device file. The data is sent to the network as is, without encapsulating it in
any protocol, therefore the application will have to build the various headers
for each packet. The application usually does not need to generate the FCS
because it is calculated by the network adapter hardware and it is attached
automatically at the end of a packet before sending it to the network.</p>
<p>In normal situations, the sending rate of the packets to the network is not
very high because of the need of a system call for each packet. For this reason,
the possibility to send a single packet more than once with a single write
system call has been added. The user-level application can set, with an IOCTL
call (code pBIOCSWRITEREP), the number of times a single packet will be
repeated: for example, if this value is set to 1000, every raw packet written by
the application on the driver's device file will be sent 1000 times. This
feature can be used to generate high speed traffic for testing purposes: the
overload of context switches is no longer present, so performance is remarkably
better.&nbsp;</p>

<h4> Network monitoring</h4>
<p>WinPcap offers a kernel-level programmable monitoring
module, able to calculate simple statistics on the network traffic. The
idea behind this module is shown in Figure
2: the statistics can be gathered without the need to copy the packets to
the application, that simply receives and displays the results obtained from the
monitoring engine. This allows to avoid great part of the capture overhead in
terms of memory and CPU clocks.</p>
<p>The monitoring engine is
made of a <i>classifier</i> followed by a <i>counter</i>. The packets are
classified using the filtering engine of NPF, that provides a configurable way
to select a subset of the traffic. The data that pass the filter go to the
counter, that keeps some variables like the number of packets and
the amount of bytes accepted by the filter and updates them with the data of the
incoming packets. These variables are passed to the user-level application at
regular intervals whose period can be configured by the user. No buffers are
allocated at kernel and user level.</p>
<h4>Dump to disk</h4>
<p>The dump to disk
capability can be used to save the network data to disk directly from kernel
mode.
</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="npf-dump.gif" width="400" height="187">
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 3: packet capture versus kernel-level dump.</b>
</p>
<p>In
traditional systems, the path covered by the packets that are saved to disk is
the one followed by the black arrows in Figure
3: every packet is copied several times, and normally 4 buffers are
allocated: the one of the capture driver, the one in the application that keeps
the captured data, the one of the stdio functions (or similar) that are used by
the application to write on file, and finally the one of the file system.

</p>
<p>When the
kernel-level traffic logging feature of NPF is enabled, the capture driver
addresses the file system directly, hence the path covered by the packets is the
one of the red dotted arrow: only two buffers and a single copy are necessary,
the number of system call is drastically reduced, therefore the performance is
considerably better.

</p>
<p>Current
implementation dumps the to disk in the widely used libpcap format. It gives
also the possibility to filter the traffic before the dump process in order to
select the packet that will go to the disk.

<p>The code documented in this manual is the one of the Windows NTx version of
NPF.&nbsp;The Windows 9x code is very similar, but it is less efficient and
lacks advanced features like kernel-mode dump.</p>
